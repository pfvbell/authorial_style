# authorial_style

This project was completed as part of CS109b: Advanced topics in data science. The main aim was to use machine learning to support an important debate within the Biblical scholarship community over authorship of the Hebrew Bible. It has been traditionally believed that the Hebrew Bible is a composite text woven from several seperate sources. Using literary analysis, Biblical scholars have identified differences in style between several seperate sections of text. 

In this project a fine-tuned BERT model is used along with unsupervised clustering to interrogate this 'Documentary Hypothesis'. Although Biblical authorial identification is a very challenging debate to provie new insight on, however the results largely support the canonical Documentary Hypothesis.
